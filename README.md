# Face-Matcher
Leveraged a pre-trained CNN Model (DeepFace) for facial recognition.

Tech Stack: DeepFace, Matplotlib, OpenCV
  •	Used VGG-Face model for image comparison and RetinaFace as backend model for facial detection
  •	Utilized OpenCV to process and display images
  •	Leveraged Matplotlib to create subplots for displaying individual faces detected in group photos
